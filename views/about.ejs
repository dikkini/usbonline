	<h2>Thought, how to do it easy and online</h2>
	<p>We have a thought about bootable USB drive with more than one ISO image without lost important data... online!
		For a example, when you need bootable USB drive - you bought a brand new MacBook with OSX El Capitan,
		but you are Windows user. Your current notebook with Windows or Linux onboard died, you have to rescue data
		than check for viruses, reinstall Windows-notebook to bring it to your young sister and all of this actions
		could be done without pain with just one bootable usb with 3-4 bootable software on board.
		But multiple USB it is not easy thing. It is something like GRUB or LiLo.
		And now you have to start searching some information how to do it. You are wasting time and money.
		You became tired and stressed. Our application let you do bootable USB drive online into your browser
		(for now supports only Internet Explorer, but it is just for now).
